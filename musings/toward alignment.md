# Toward Alignment
By Abe Dillon

## Abstract 
In this article, I propose a path to achieve alignment among intelligent systems based upon a rigorous formalization of the following definition of life as: <a system that accumulates and preserves information, particularly information relevant to accumulating and preserving information>(work in progress).

I introduce the alignment problem, why it's important, and what criteria will constitute a solution. Then, I explain why I believe a formalization of life is relevant, how I arrived at the above definition, and how it might lead to alignment. Finally, I evaluate my proposal against the criteria I established earlier and follow-up with discussion about what insight we gained and what questions remain open.

## Background
### Motivation
The alignment problem is typically framed in the context of artificial intelligence: What if we set a machine to work brutally optimizing solutions to satisfy a goal that's poorly aligned with the good of humanity? In that context, much has already been written about the potential danger posed as machines become increasingly powerfull at optimization. However, I believe we should consider a more general definition of the problem which omits the "artificial" qualifier because it distracts from the nature of the problem. Then we can see that humans can be unaligned with humans, or larger systems like economies can be unaligned with human interests, and octopuses can be unaligned with extra terrestrials.

The general alignment problem is not just about the hypothetical threat posed by artificial intelligence. It's at the heart of every ideological conflict and it's the reason Global Capitalism externalizes the cost of human suffering and ecological degredation. Whenever perverse incentives yield unwanted behavior in an intelligent system, wheter it be addiction in the human brain or regulatory capture in a government, a poorly defined and/or implemented goal is likely to blame.
