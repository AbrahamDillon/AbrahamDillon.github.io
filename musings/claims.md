A system is living if and only if it collects and preserves information.
Living systems are therefore anentropic thus cannot be closed systems within an entropic universe.
The anentropic action of a living system must be afforded by greater entropy somewhere else in the universe.
The inherent goal of a living system is to collect and preserve information.
There is an inherent bias toward information related to the goal of collecting and preserving information.
The most essential component of a living system is the physical embodiment of its information.
That phisical embodiment of information is the essential "self".
A living reinforcement learning agent will develop a world model with a highly developed self model at the center.
That self-model implies self-awareness. Consciousness is a story we tell ourselves inwhich our self-model plays the protagonist.
The concept of cooperation complicates the nature of the "self".
