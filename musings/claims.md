A system is living if and only if it collects, encodes(?), and preserves information.

...geological reccord?

Living systems are therefore anentropic thus cannot be closed systems within an entropic universe. 

Their existence must be afforded by greater entropy somewhere else in the universe, like fusion in a star.

The inherent goal of a living system is to collect and preserve information.

There is an inherent bias toward information related to the goal of collecting and preserving information. 

Early living systems must have consisted of an extensible medium for encoding information which could replicate.

They couldn't actively gather information like organisms with brains, rather; they preserved information through self-replication.

Darwinian evolution would effectively imprint information about how to survive upon the replicating medium.

The most essential component of a living system, the "self", is the physical embodiment of its information.

...reinforcement learning world model

A living reinforcement learning agent will develop a world model with a detailed self-model at the center.

That self-model implies self-awareness. Greater fidelity implies greater self-awareness.

Consciousness is a story an agent tell itself inwhich its self-model plays the protagonist.

The concept of cooperation complicates the nature of the "self".

Shared information and cooperative networks...

Conflict...
