The word, "artificial", in the name of the feild of artificial intelligence (AI) implies it to be a discipline of engineering, however; research and development in the feild also covers science, math, and philosophy. In those areas, the specification of a system's origin is largely irrelvant and including it can restrict one's perspective. For instance: the so-called, "alignment problem", is often defined in the context of AI[1] when it could just as easily refer to alignment between any intelligent agents whether they be biological, artificial, or extraterrestrial.

[1] As of this writing, the Wikipedia article on the alignment problem is titled, "AI Alignment".
