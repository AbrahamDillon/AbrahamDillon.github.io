The word, "artificial", in the name of the feild of artificial intelligence (AI) implies that AI is a discipline of engineering rather than a science. A science of intelligence would be concerned with the phenomenon of intelligence in its own right, regardless of origin. The lack of such a science is a detriment to the field of AI as the lack of the science of fluid dynamics would be to aeronautical engineering. It also forces many AI researchers to engage in science within the often-unnessesary context of artificiality which can restrict one's perspective. For instance: the so-called, "alignment problem", is often defined in the context of AI[1] when it could just as easily refer to alignment between any intelligent agents whether they be biological, artificial, or extraterrestrial.

[1] As of this writing, the Wikipedia article on the alignment problem is titled, "AI Alignment".
