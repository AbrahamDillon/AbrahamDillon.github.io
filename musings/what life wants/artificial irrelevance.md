Artificial Irrlevance 
by Abe Dillon

The word, "artificial", in the name of the feild of artificial intelligence (AI) implies it to be a discipline of engineering, however; research and development in the feild also covers science, math, and philosophy. In those areas, the specification of a system's origin is largely irrelvant. In which case, including it risks confusion and restricting our perspective on the subject.

Ideally, an engineering feild should draw from feilds of science which model a particular phenomenon regardless of its origin. Aeronautical engineering draws from fluid dynamics. There is no scientific feild of "artificial fluid dynamics"[1]. The feild of AI is overextended because we currently lack a science devoted to the nature of the phenomenon of intelligence regardless of implementation details.

[1] One could argue that aeronautical engineering also draws from the science of avian anatomy, which is implementation-specific; but...
