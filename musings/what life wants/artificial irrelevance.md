Artificial Irrlevance 
by Abe Dillon

The word, "artificial"; in the name of the feild of artificial intelligence (AI) implies it to be a discipline of engineering. However; research and development in the feild also covers science, math, and philosophy. In those areas, the specification of a system's origin is largely irrelvant and including it may restrict our perspective. For instance: the so-called "alignment problem" is often defined in the context of AI[1] when it could just as easily refer to alignment between any intelligent agents whether they be biological, artificial, or extraterrestrial.

Ideally, an engineering field should be based upon science fields which model a particular phenomenon regardless of its origin. For instance: many developments in aeronautical engineering are based on the science of fluid dynamics. There is no scientific feild of "artificial fluid dynamics"[2] because fluidity is a phenomenon in its own right. The feild of AI is overextended because we currently lack a science devoted to the nature of intelligence as a phenomenon in its own right.

[1] As of this writing, the Wikipedia article on the alignment problem is titled, "AI Alignment".
[2] One could argue that aeronautical engineering is also based on the science of avian anatomy, which is implementation-specific. However, I would argue that: while aeronautical engineers can draw inspiration from aivan anatomy, ...
